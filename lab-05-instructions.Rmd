# Learning goals

-   Know how to use read and write functions
-   Practice fixing variable names, types and recoding factors when reading

```{r photo, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 2, fig.cap = "Data Importing with readr and readxl", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/readr.png")
knitr::include_graphics("img/readxl.png")
```

## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.

-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document. üß∂
-   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. ‚úÖ
-   Push your changes to GitHub.Ô∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
-   Go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd files.

## Data

For this lab, we will be using the `earthquakes` dataset from the `{openintro}` package we have used before and we will also need `{tidyverse}` for some data wrangling.

## Packages

The package `{readr}` is automatically loaded with the `tidyverse`.
`{readxl}` is also part of the `tidyverse` but it is not automatically loaded.
We'll also load `{skimr}` to get a detailed look at data frames and `{janitor}` to automate cleaning of variable names.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(openintro)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
```

# Lab Exercises

First, let's look at `earthquakes` with `skim`.
Copy the code chunk below into Exercise 1 in the starter file.

```{r inspect-earthquakes}
skim(earthquakes)
```

1.  Add text narrative below the output explaining briefly why we are able to view `earthquakes` without first using a `read_()` function.

### End of Exercise 1

The `earthquake` version you have just viewed using `skim` is the final version.  

We've provided three partial datasets in the `/data` folder of your RStudio project.  

Let's remake the original file.  

2.  Identify the three partial datasets within the starter file `/data` folder of your your project directory (`earthquakes-1 to earthquakes-3`).  

* Insert a code chunk under Exercise 2 in your starter file. 
* Import the three files into RStudio using three lines of code and an appropriate read function for each file. 
* We give you some partial code below to get started on the first one.
  + Update the label to reflect what you're doing in the code chunk.

```{r label-me1, eval=FALSE}
earthquakes_1 <- read_csv("data/___")
```


### End of Exercise 2

3.  Write a labeled code chunk to view the imported data frames under Exercise 3 in your starter file, and comment with text narrative on:  

* What is missing from each data frame when compared to the `openintro::earthquakes` version?  
* What is strange about the `deaths` variable in the object you created when importing `earthquakes-3.xlsx`?  
* Why will the code chunk below (labeled `coerce-earthquakes-3`) fix the problem with `deaths`?  

After you respond to these three prompts, make sure you copy the code chunk **below** into your starter file under your responses to exercise 3.

Notice that the syntax for `col_types` within `read_xlsx`, is slightly different compared to the syntax for `read_csv` or `read_txt`. Always check the function help page if you're not sure!  


```{r coerce-earthquakes-3, message = F, warning = F}
earthquakes_3 <- read_xlsx("data/earthquakes-3.xlsx", col_types = c("numeric", 
                                                                    "text",
                                                                    "numeric",
                                                                    "numeric"))
```

### End of Exercise 3

**Note:** We can use `package::function` or `package::object` when specifying (exactly) a function or object from a particular package.

4.  Insert a labeled code chunk that uses a pipeline of **join** functions to merge the data from the three partial datasets.  

* Don't assign the output to anything.
* Pipe the joined data into `skim()`.
* Finally, confirm the output roughly matches that of the `inspect-earthquakes` chunk at the start of this lab.

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

### End of Exercise 4

For Exercises 5-10, you will practice using the importing functionality covered in lecture.  

We have provided labeled code chunks and limited code that you should copy into the starter file, but the rest is up to you!  


5.  Write a pipeline that first reads `earthquakes-badnames-na.csv` into RStudio using an appropriate function, and then provides a glimpse of the dataset. Use the code below to get you started.

```{r read-inspect, eval = F}
read_csv("___/earthquakes-badnames-na.csv") %>% 
  glimpse()
```

### End of Exercise 5

6.  Complete and add to the code below such that `earthquakes-badnames-na.csv` is read into RStudio and that **sets** any bad values ("." and "NA") to `NA`.

```{r fix-nas, eval = F}
read_csv("___/earthquakes-badnames-na.csv") 
```

### End of Exercise 6

7.  Copy your code from exercise 6 above into the next exercise 7 chunk labeled `fix-names`.  

* Start a pipeline whose first step is to fix the variable names in the data frame.
* You will first have to identify any problems with the names.

```{r fix-names, message = F, warning = F}

```

### End of Exercise 7

8.  Copy your code from exercise 7 into the next exercise 8 chunk labeled `fix-richter`.  

* Using `mutate` and `case_when()`, add to the pipeline so that the bad values in the variable `richter` ("seven") are corrected.
* Then **coerce** the entire column to type numeric.

```{r fix-richter, message = F, warning = F}

```

### End of Exercise 8

9.  Copy your code from exercise 8 into the next exercise 9 labeled `revlevel-month`.  

* Add to the mutate function so that the default alphabetical ordering of the `month` variable is re-leveled to match the natural ordering of the months (January through December).
* Assign the new output to `earthquakes_correct`. 
* Add a second, short pipeline that takes `earthquakes_correct` as input and applies the `count()` function.
* Use the output to confirm that the `month` factor levels are ordered correctly.

```{r relevel-month, message = F, warning = F}

```

### End of Exercise 9

10. Write a new short a pipeline that writes `earthquakes_correct` as an `.rds` file.  

* In a separate pipeline, use `readRDS` to read the file back in.
* Use count() again to confirm that the ordering of `month` is retained in an RDS file.

```{r write-read-rds, message = F, warning = F}

```

### End of Exercise 10

Great work!
You just built an elaborate pipeline that combined importing, wrangling, and writing functions!

You are finished with Lab 5!
